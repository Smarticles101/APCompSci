<p><b>Administrative note:</b> The original designer of this
assignment, David Matuszek of the University of Pennsylvania, assigned
grades as the percentage of times that their Rabbit program succeeds.
I have not tried the assignment in the classroom, so I can't vouch for
it myself. Additionally, I have rewritten his code; I don't
think the changes make success substantially more difficult, but it's
possible.</p>

<p><b>Objectives:</b><ul>

<li>To improve understanding of classes, objects, and inheritance</p>

<li>To give more practice in reading code as well as writing code</p>

<li>To demonstrate non-algorithmic programming</p>

</ul></p>

<p>A fox is hunting a rabbit in a field. The field contains a number of
bushes which obstruct both the fox's view and the rabbit's view, so
each may or may not be able to see the other.  If the fox catches the
rabbit, the fox eats it and wins. If the rabbit can keep away from the
fox for 100 turns, the rabbit wins. </p>

<p>You are the rabbit.</p>

<p>When you compile the distributed files and run the RabbitHunt class,
you will see a diagram of the field.
<center><img src=hunt-small.png></center>
The big red dot represents the fox, the small brown dot is the
rabbit, and the green blobs are bushes.</p>

<p>Run the program a few times and see what happens. Notice that you
can step through the hunt, or you can just let it run. You can adjust
the speed at which the animation proceeds. (This does not affect what
happens, only how quickly it happens.)  The rabbit almost
always meets an untimely end. However, occasionally the rabbit will
evade the fox for 100 turns, and the rabbit wins - this doesn't happen
very often.</p>

<p>Now look at the Rabbit class. It has a constructor method, and it
has a <code>decide</code> method for determining how the rabbit moves
each turn. The rabbit I've given you is a really
stupid rabbit - it just moves randomly.</p>

<p>Your job is to improve the Rabbit class so that the rabbit escapes
more often. You can edit this file in any way you wish; however,
you cannot edit the other files, although you are welcome - and
encouraged - to look at them.</p>

<p>Your program should not assume that the grid is always 22x22,
even though the RabbitHunt program happens to use a 22x22 grid.
Your class can access the grid's size via the Game class described
below. You can easily test other grid sizes yourself by editing
the first line of RabbitHunt's <code>main</code> method.</p>

<p>It is probably impossible to find a strategy for the rabbit that
ensures a 100% survival rate.</p>

<h2>Useful classes</h2>

<p>There are several classes in the program; besides the Rabbit
class, you will be able to make use of four others. This section
briefly describes these classes and what you might find useful in each.
You can get additional information by reading the classes
themselves.</p>

<p>Although your code will not be able to use it directly, the Fox
class is a useful example of a sophisticated animal using all of these
classes together to compute its own decision in each turn.</p>

<h3>Direction class</h3>

<p>Direction objects represent one of the eight objects that an
animal can move each turn. Because the constructor is private,
you cannot create Direction objects; you can, however, access
them through the constants provided in the class,
<code>NORTH</code>, <code>NORTHEAST</code>, <code>EAST</code>,
<code>SOUTHEAST</code>, <code>SOUTH</code>, etc.</p>

<p><table>
<tr><td valign=top><code>static int NUM_DIRECTIONS</code></td>
	<td>The number of directions (8).</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getDeltaX()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the change in columns with each step in this direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getDeltaY()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the change in rows with each step in this direction.
	(Note that northward movement increases the row index.)</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>Direction rotate(int steps)</code></td>
	<td>Returns the direction clockwise from this direction by
	<code>steps</code> 45-degree steps.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Entity class</h3>

<p>Represents something in the field - a bush, a rabbit, or a
fox. Your class will see Entity objects in two ways: It receives the
rabbit entity via its constructor, and Player's
<code>look</code> method will return other entities.</p>

<p><table>
<tr><td valign=top><code>boolean isBush()</code></td>
	<td>Returns <code>true</code> if this entity is a bush.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>boolean isRabbit()</code></td>
	<td>Returns <code>true</code> if this entity is a rabbit.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>boolean isFox()</code></td>
	<td>Returns <code>true</code> if this entity is a fox.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getRow()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the row that this entity currently occupies.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getColumn()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the column that this entity currently
	occupies.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int distanceTo(Entity other)</code></td>
	<td>Returns the minimum number of steps to get from this entity to
	another.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Player class</h3>

<p>Your Rabbit class extends the Player class. Notice that there
is both a Rabbit player and a rabbit entity; you can think of
the player as the rabbit's mind, and the entity as the rabbit's
body.  The Rabbit class inherits some useful methods from the
Player class.</p>

<p><table>
<tr><td valign=top><code>Entity look(Direction where)</code></td>
	<td>Returns the first entity visible in the given
	direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>boolean canMove(Direction where)</code></td>
	<td>Returns <code>true</code> if the move is legal - that
	is, if there isn't a bush blocking the way.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getStepCount()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the number of steps completed so far.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h3>Game class</h3>

<p>The Game class provides data related to the overall game.
Your class will receive the Game object via the constructor
method.</td>

<p><table>
<tr><td valign=top><code>static int MAX_RABBIT_STEPS</code></td>
	<td>The number of steps the rabbit needs to survive.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getRowCount()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the number of rows in the grid.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int getColumnCount()</code></td>
	<td>Returns the number of columns in the grid.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>int randomInt(int min, int max)</code></td>
	<td>Returns a random integer from the range given,
	inclusive.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top><code>Direction randomDirection()</code></td>
	<td>Returns a randomly chosen direction.</td></tr>
</table>
Whenever your class wants to do something random, it should use
<code>randomInt</code> or <code>randomDirection</code>.
If you don't do this, than choosing replay in the program won't
work accurately.</p>
